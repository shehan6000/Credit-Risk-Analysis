# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project involves developing models to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on applicant data. The goal is to generate synthetic data, train machine learning models, and recommend each participant's credit risk as a score. The project uses Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models for prediction and evaluation.

## Features

- Synthetic data generation
- Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score
- Predicting credit risk scores for each applicant
- Output results in a CSV file
